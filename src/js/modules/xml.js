		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Podcasts are getting more and more popular to use for marketing purposes, as they are a personal and effective way to share information and content. For many organizations, podcasts can help build and strengthen customer relations.</p><p>Starting a podcast is not rocket science. There are, however, a few things that you need to take into consideration if you want to master the process from the very first idea to the actual launch of your episode.</p><p>We&rsquo;re glad you&rsquo;re excited about the topic, and perhaps considering launching your own show! In this article, we will go through the most essential issues to keep in mind when getting started. Make sure to take a look at our <strong>infographic</strong> at the end of this article, if you&rsquo;d prefer a visual representation of the process.</p><h2><a href="#1">1. Content</a></h2><ul><li>Topic and name</li><li>Target group</li><li>Type of content</li><li>Length of episodes and publishing frequency</li><li>Music</li><li>Intro and outro</li><li>CTA</li><li>Cover art</li><li>Show notes</li></ul><h2><a href="#2">2. Equipment</a></h2><ul><li>Microphone</li><li>Recording and editing program</li><li>Studio</li></ul><h2><a href="#3">3. Launch</a></h2><ul><li>Media host</li><li>Streaming platform</li></ul><h2><a href="#4">4. Promotion</a></h2><ul><li>Social media</li><li>Blog and website</li><li>Cross promotion</li></ul><p><strong>Let&#39;s get started!</strong></p><h2><a name="1"></a>1. Content</h2><h3>Topic and name</h3><p>First things first &ndash; you need a topic. Do you want to discuss general trends in your industry or dig deeper into a niche topic? The sky&#39;s the limit here! You can, of course, talk about different topics in different episodes, but it&rsquo;s good to have a steady basis to stand on. That way your audience can fully grasp the main idea of your podcast from the very beginning and stay engaged.</p><p>In some cases, it might be a good idea to try to include a keyword related to your topic in the <strong>name of your podcast</strong>. This way the people will instantly recognize what your podcast is about, and this might attract new listeners who are interested in the subject.</p><p>However, you don&rsquo;t want your name to be too generic. Try to come up with a catchy name that is easy to remember. Be creative! For organizations, it&rsquo;s typical to include your brand name in the name of the podcast as well.</p><p>When it comes to single episodes, you might want to focus on a niche topic and name the episodes accordingly. This way you can clearly communicate which new or unique perspective or thoughts you will be bringing to the conversation. This will set you apart from your competitors, and get the listener to pick your episode to listen to.</p><h3>Target group</h3><p>Talking about your listeners, do you have an idea of what your potential audience is going to be like? To create content that truly interests your listeners, it is essential to know which target group you are aiming to reach, as this can guide you through the entire process.</p><p>What kind of language are you going to use? How will you be promoting the podcast? What kind of themes should you discuss in your episodes? Should there be a specific format or repeated elements in each of your episodes that would get your listeners to return later on?</p><h3><strong>Type of content</strong></h3><p>Even though your episodes don&rsquo;t have to be too similar, and you can even try something new for each of them if you want to, you should still consider following some kind of a format or pattern in them. There are many kinds of content that you can try out, such as:</p><ul><li>General discussion &ndash; either by yourself or with another person</li><li>Interviews</li><li>Lessons about your topic</li><li>News-like overviews of the events in your field</li><li>Q&amp;A sections</li></ul><p>Following a pattern in your episodes can increase the recognizability of your podcast and therefore help engage your listeners.</p><h3>Publishing frequency and length of your episodes</h3><p>You should also decide how long you want your episodes to be, and how often you want to publish them. Producing your first episode will require some time and effort, but as you start to form your very own podcasting routine, the process becomes much easier.</p><p>Consistency is key in building an engaged audience. By publishing on a regular schedule, your listeners will know when to expect a new episode from you, and they&rsquo;ll be ready waiting.</p><p>For some podcasters, a good aim is to publish a longer episode once a week or every two weeks, as long as you have quality content to share in every episode. If your episodes are shorter, on the other hand, you can of course share new content more frequently. It all depends on your topic, podcast format, and listeners.</p><h3>Music</h3><p>Music is optional. Including music in your podcast can spice up the content, but it usually also involves some navigation in the legal jungle.</p><p>There are a few myths about the use of copyrighted material. The most common one is perhaps the so-called 30 second-rule, according to which it&rsquo;s allegedly okay to use copyrighted music as long as it is under 30 seconds. In reality, however, if you haven&rsquo;t secured the rights to the copyrighted media, you are not allowed to use it in your episode &ndash; not even for a second.</p><p>If you want to use music in your podcast, you can purchase the right to use the media, or try to ask for permission from the copyright holder.</p><p>Luckily, there are other ways to use music and sounds in your podcast &ndash; for free, even. If your budget is tight, you can use stock music. There are a number of websites where you can download stock music and sounds for free. Just keep in mind that there can be some requirements attached to the usage of the media (free to use, not-for-profit only, requires attribution in the credits).</p><h3>Intro and outro</h3><p>Regardless of whether you choose to use music or not, adding an intro and outro to your episodes is always a good idea. It&rsquo;s a nice way to frame the episodes, and a signature tune also makes it easy to recognize and remember your show. You can also try to use a jingle to separate different topics or sections within the episodes.</p><h3>CTA</h3><p>Activate your audience by including a <a href="https://www.lianatech.com/resources/blog/7-tips-for-using-call-to-actions-infographic.html" target="_blank">Call-to-Action </a>in your episodes. Encourage them to leave you a review, follow you on social media, or to send you questions for your next episode, if you have a Q&amp;A section in your episodes, for example.</p><p>Companies especially should also encourage their listeners to visit their website, subscribe to their newsletter, or to try their product or service.</p><h3>Cover art</h3><p>You will also need a cover picture for your podcast. Make sure you choose a cover that suits you and your content. Since there is an unlimited selection of podcasts, you should put some effort into creating a good and interesting-looking cover to stand out from the crowd. You can look for inspiration by looking at other podcasts&rsquo; cover images, or from <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/" target="_blank">Pinterest</a>, for instance.</p><p><img alt="" height="1170" kv_aslink="0" src="https://www.lianatech.com/media/blog/how-to-get-started-with-podcasts-infographic/spotify-podcast-charts-example.png" width="800" /></p><p class="small"><em>Which of these <a href="https://www.spotify.com/" target="_blank">Spotify</a>&rsquo;s Top Podcasts USA list&rsquo;s podcasts catch your attention based on the cover art alone? What thoughts or emotions do they evoke, and what do they potentially tell you about the actual content?</em></p><p>It&rsquo;s recommended that you don&rsquo;t use a picture smaller than 1400x1400px, as it will be displayed on different devices, such as mobile phones, tablets, computers, TVs, and so on. Also, make sure to take the different screen sizes into consideration, if you want to include text in the cover art. Keep the text very short, only about 1-4 words long, to make sure that it&rsquo;s easy to read on all screens.</p><h3>Show notes</h3><p>Write show notes for each episode. A brief and well-written description catches your potential listeners&rsquo; attention.</p><p>You can, for example, highlight the most important themes of the episode, tell about your guest if you have one, or add time stamps, so that the listener can jump right into the section they&rsquo;re interested in hearing.</p><p><img alt="" height="800" kv_aslink="0" src="https://www.lianatech.com/media/blog/how-to-get-started-with-podcasts-infographic/song-exploder-example.png" width="800" /></p><p class="small"><em>The <a href="https://songexploder.net/" target="_blank">Song Exploder</a> podcast invites musicians to take apart their songs and tell the listeners how they were written.

They also create a post for each episode on their website.</em></p><h2><span style="font-family: Metrophobic, 'Istok Web', Tahoma, Arial, Verdana, SimSun, 宋体, STXihei, 华文细黑, sans-serif; font-size: 28px;"><a name="2"></a>2. Equipme</span><span style="font-family: Metrophobic, 'Istok Web', Tahoma, Arial, Verdana, SimSun, 宋体, STXihei, 华文细黑, sans-serif; font-size: 28px;">nt</span></h2><h3>Microphone</h3><p>Obviously, you will need a microphone, and most preferably a good one. The microphone has the biggest effect on the quality of the recording and that is why it is so important to choose the right one for your needs. There are many types of microphones to use:</p><ul><li><strong>Your computer&#39;s built-in mic</strong><br />Your computer&#39;s built-in microphone is an easy and accessible option, as you don&rsquo;t need to purchase anything new. Most of the time, however, your the microphone doesn&#39;t have the required quality for podcast recordings. It will pick up too much of the noise in the room and make the sound fuzzy.</li><li><strong>External web camera with a built-in microphone</strong><br />These types of cameras are mainly meant for video conferences, and quality-wise they&rsquo;re typically not good enough for podcasts either.</li><li><strong>Headset, handsfree</strong><br />Many smaller podcasts or startups often use common headsets. This type of a microphone is typically meant for phone calls or video calls.</li><li><strong>External microphone</strong><br />These types of microphones are very cost-effective and give the best sound. It is highly recommended to use an external microphone for podcasting.</li></ul><p>For podcasts, high quality audio is essential. You don&rsquo;t want your listeners to be annoyed by background noises or fuzzy sounds. Many people listen to podcasts with headphones or earbuds, which can highlight the poor quality even more. In that case, it doesn&rsquo;t matter how interesting your content is &ndash; people will turn off your episode anyway.</p><div class="Article__Quote ckeditor-template ckeditor-template-section"><div class="Article__QuoteBubble ckeditor-template-section">&ldquo;Even the best content out there won&rsquo;t do the trick, if the audio quality is poor. That&rsquo;s why I recommend purchasing an external microphone early on.&rdquo;</div><div class="Article__QuotePerson ckeditor-template-section"><div class="Article__QuoteImage ckeditor-template-section"><img alt="" height="64" kv_aslink="0" src="https://www.lianatech.com/media/blog/how-to-get-started-with-podcasts-infographic/harri_niskala_64x64.jpg" width="64" /></div><div><div class="Article__QuoteName ckeditor-template-section">Harri Niskala</div><div class="Article__QuoteTitle ckeditor-template-section">Marketing Development Representative &amp; Podcast Host, Liana Technologies</div></div></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It&rsquo;s highly recommended to use an external microphone with a USB cord for podcasts. It is also the most cost-effective way &ndash; a microphone doesn&rsquo;t have to cost a fortune to be good. You can get a really good microphone with only about $100-150 that not only gives you a clear sound, but also picks up sound from different directions, which makes it ideal for podcasting.</p><p>You can also use the same mic for webinars, web courses, interviews, presentations, and videos.</p><div class="alert border border-200 bg-100">A <strong>pro tip</strong> is to talk close to the microphone to make sure the audio is clear. If there are many people speaking, you should all aim to keep the same distance from the microphone. You can also use a cover on your mic to reduce unwanted noises and make the quality even better.</div><h3>Recording and editing program</h3><p>To be able to actually record the sound you get from your new microphone, you need a recording program. First of all, you need a device to record the sound with &ndash; such as a phone, a tablet, or a computer. For Mac, you can use Garageband, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/se/app/logic-pro-x/id634148309">Logic Pro X</a>, or <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/audacity/">Audacity</a>,&nbsp;which you can download for free. You also can use <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/audacity/">Audacity</a>&nbsp;for PC, as well as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.adobe.com/se/products/audition.html">Adobe Audition</a>,&nbsp;or <a href="https://hindenburg.com/">Hindenburg</a>, to name a few.</p><div class="Article__Quote ckeditor-template ckeditor-template-section"><div class="Article__QuoteBubble ckeditor-template-section">&ldquo;Editing allows you to keep a certain rhythm and flow in your episodes!&rdquo;</div><div class="Article__QuotePerson ckeditor-template-section"><div class="Article__QuoteImage ckeditor-template-section"><img alt="" height="64" kv_aslink="0" src="https://www.lianatech.com/media/blog/how-to-get-started-with-podcasts-infographic/harri_niskala_64x64.jpg" width="64" /></div><div><div class="Article__QuoteName ckeditor-template-section">Harri Niskala</div><div class="Article__QuoteTitle ckeditor-template-section">Marketing Development Representative &amp; Podcast Host, Liana Technologies</div></div></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you want to record an episode remotely with another person, you can use a video call application such as Skype. In that case, a separate recording program such as <a href="https://www.ecamm.com/" target="_blank">Ecamm</a> or <a href="https://rogueamoeba.com/piezo/" target="_blank">Piezo</a> will help you maintain the best audio quality possible.</p><p>You can also try to record your episode with Garageband, but it can take some time and effort to find the right settings. In addition, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.talk&amp;hl=en" target="_blank">Hangout</a> has a handy feature for these types of recordings, where you can connect your phone to your computer during a normal phone call.</p><p><img alt="" height="460" kv_aslink="0" src="https://www.lianatech.com/media/blog/how-to-get-started-with-podcasts-infographic/edit-audio-example.png" width="750" /></p><h3>Studio</h3><p>Obviously, the best place to record a podcast is in a studio, but there are other suitable and more accessible options too. A small room with lots of textiles such as curtains, carpets, drapes, and cushions that reduce unwanted sounds and echo works as well. A closet is a perfect example of such space.</p><h2><a name="3"></a>3. Launch</h2><h3>Media host</h3><p>To manage and deliver playbacks of your podcast episodes to your listeners without interruption, you need a reliable media host. Managing a single episode is pretty easy, but the problem starts when you gather many episodes in your podcast series &ndash; especially if you store your files in your web host.</p><p>Let&rsquo;s say that 5 people, or 50 or even 500 people want to listen to your podcast at the same time &ndash; meaning there are 500 people streaming or downloading your episodes. This will result in your web host&rsquo;s server not working properly, and your (and others&rsquo; on the same server) web pages not loading.</p><p>Streaming sites like Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Stitcher, and Acast do not store any media, so you need a media host to store them yourself. You will then use a RSS feed to distribute your media to the streaming sites.</p><p>Here are some examples on web hosts:</p><ul><li><a href="https://libsyn.com/">Libsyn</a></li><li><a href="https://www.podbean.com/">Podbean</a></li><li><a href="https://simplecast.com/">Simplecast</a></li><li><a href="https://www.buzzsprout.com/">Buzzsprout</a></li></ul><p>Now your podcast is finally ready to be launched!</p><h3>Streaming platform</h3><p>Naturally, you want to share it where people can easily find it. Some good examples are:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-podcasts/" target="_blank">Apple Podcasts</a></li><li><a href="https://www.stitcher.com/">Stitcher</a></li><li><a href="https://www.acast.com/">Acast</a></li><li><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.podcasts&amp;hl=en_US">Google Podcasts</a></li><li><a href="https://www.spotify.com/">Spotify</a></li><li><a href="https://creators.soundcloud.com/podcasting">SoundCloud</a></li></ul><p>One thing to keep in mind is that Apple Podcasts typically wants to review your media before the launch, and that can take anywhere from 12 hours to a week.</p><p>Once you&rsquo;ve published your first episode, it&rsquo;s time to get people to <em>listen</em> to it.</p><h2><a name="4"></a>4. Promotion</h2><h3>Social media</h3><p>The first and perhaps the easiest channel for promoting your podcast and new episodes is social media. Make posts about your podcast on your organization&rsquo;s social media accounts, or if you&rsquo;re starting a podcast alone or with a friend, create social media accounts for it on the most important platforms.</p><p>Announce your new episodes or post teasers about upcoming ones beforehand. You can, for example, include a short audio preview of the episode and publish it on social media. Choose a section that will make the listeners want to hear more.</p><p><img alt="" height="763" kv_aslink="0" src="https://www.lianatech.com/media/blog/how-to-get-started-with-podcasts-infographic/sysk-podcast-twitter-example.png" width="800" /></p><p class="small"><em>The <a href="https://twitter.com/SYSKPodcast" target="_blank">Stuff You Should Know</a> podcast posts interesting tweets about the miscellaneous niche topics they discuss in each episode.</em></p><p>In addition, social media provides a platform for your listeners to discuss the themes of your podcast episodes. Especially if you focus on a niche topic and your target group is clearly defined, you can create an engaged and active online community around your podcast.&nbsp;</p><p>This way your podcast not only provides the listeners valuable information on the topic, but also allows like-minded people to network.&nbsp;</p><h3>Blog and website</h3><p>If your organization is starting a podcast, it is a good idea to make a blog post on your web page about the topic of the episode. This way you can offer your audience some extra information about the topic or your products and services.&nbsp;</p><h3>Cross promotion</h3><p>Cross promotion is an effective way to increase your visibility. By inviting guests to your podcast, you&rsquo;re not only providing your audience with useful information from other specialists in the field, but also reaching new target groups, if your guests share the episode with their followers. You can also visit other podcasts to grow your audience.</p><p>Make sure to promote your podcast on your other marketing channels as well, such as your newsletter or even email signatures.</p><p><img alt="" class="shadow-image" height="2356" kv_aslink="0" src="https://www.lianatech.com/media/blog/how-to-get-started-with-podcasts-infographic/cache/starting-you-own-podcast-infographic-2021-800x2356.png" width="800" /><img alt="" src="https://www.lianatech.com/media/international-pictures/news/starting-your-own-podcast-infographic-1x.jpg" /></p><h2>Want to learn more about digital marketing and communications?</h2><p><a name="blog-form-newsletter"></a></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Media Analysis Terminology</title>
		<link>https://www.lianatech.com/resources/blog/media-analysis-terminology.html</link>
		<description>Through media analysis, an organization has the opportunity to gain valuable information about its public image. However, cryptic terms can be confusing in analyses. In this article, we will dig deep itnto what terms are associated with measuring public image and visibility, reach, comparison, and value.</description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Media analysis is a great tool for an organization to get valuable information about how it&rsquo;s represented in the media. An analysis can be qualitative about an organization&rsquo;s public image, quantitative about the number of articles or mentions, or comparative to competitors. As all measuring and comparisons with different kinds of qualifications, also media analysis can contain some cryptic terms. We will now deep dive into the terminology that one encounters when examining media analyses.</p><p>The different meters can be divided into larger entities based on what they aspire to point out. These are:</p><p><a href="#näkyvyys">1.&nbsp;Visibility and public image (quantity and quality)</a><br /><a href="#tavoittavuus">2. Reach</a><br /><a href="#vertailu">3. Comparison</a><br /><a href="#arvo">4. Value</a></p><p>Every one of these entities contains a few or multiple different meters and the explanation for the terms used. Hopefully, this article brings clarity to the terminology used in media analyses!</p><h2><a name="näkyvyys"></a>1. Visibility and public image (quantity and quality)</h2><p>You should always keep in mind that visibility and public image can&rsquo;t be treated as an exact science. The results that are gotten from analyzing visibility and public image are very much defined by what type of objectives have been set for the analysis in the first place. The objectives, in turn, always depend on the organization that is the subject of media analysis.</p><p>Number of mentions</p><p>The number of media hits can simply be counted and included in the analysis. A media hit means that the organization is mentioned in any given media outlet. However, for the purposes of the final analysis, it is not always fruitful to assume that a mention is a mention, or that all mentions are equal in value. It&rsquo;s not that black and white &ndash; especially if the goal is to carry out a thoroughly done analysis. In this situation, the starting point and the defined objectives are crucial.</p><div class="alert border border-200 bg-100">The definition can be made using these three: very visible &ndash; average visibility &ndash; mentioned in passing.</div><h3>Quality of mentions</h3><p>If quantity is a bit ambiguous, then quality is definitely that. The quality of the mention can be approached from different angles, such as:</p><ul><li>Active or passive agency (interviewed or quoted vs. mentioned only and stance on an issue is not brought up)</li><li>Primary or secondary agency&nbsp;(<a href="https://www.lianatech.com/resources/blog/key-opinion-leaders-who-are-they-and-why-do-they-matter.html" target="_blank">key opinion leader status</a>, views most visibly brought up in an article e.g. in the title or lead text vs. views brought up in the same article but not mentioned e.g. in the title or lead text)</li><li>Regional divide</li><li>Media outlets that brought the most hits</li><li>Most quoted people</li><li>Mentions related to different themes</li></ul><p><img alt="" class="shadow-image" height="666" kv_aslink="0" src="https://www.lianatech.com/media/blog/media-analysis-terminology/cache/active-and-passive-agency-800x666.png" width="800" /></p><h3>Visibility of a theme or industry in the media</h3><p>A separate thematic analysis can be made of mentions around a theme or different themes. In this type of analysis, the focus can really be how an organization comes up related to a theme. Ideas on how to get earned visibility and really stand out within an industry can also surface from the analysis. It can also shed light on what kind of press releases and narratives are published around a theme or an industry.</p><p><img alt="" class="shadow-image" height="666" kv_aslink="0" src="https://www.lianatech.com/media/blog/media-analysis-terminology/cache/themes-800x666.png" width="800" /></p><h3>Social media analysis</h3><p>In social media analysis, mentions of an organization, @publishername, and possible hashtags are monitored. The sources for monitoring are usually Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and YouTube, and often also blogs and forums. The analysis can cover how hits are divided between these sources or the number of hits from a certain source and their development over time.</p><p><img alt="" class="shadow-image" height="666" kv_aslink="0" src="https://www.lianatech.com/media/blog/media-analysis-terminology/cache/social-media-800x666.png" width="800" /></p><h3>Tone</h3><p>The tone of an article or a mention can be positive, negative, or neutral. It depends on the organization what the analysis focuses on and what kind of relevance the tone is given. For example, for one organization 30% neutral while the rest is negative can be a great result, while another organization views fifty-fifty neutral and positive as a depressing result.</p><p><img alt="" class="shadow-image" height="667" kv_aslink="0" src="https://www.lianatech.com/media/blog/media-analysis-terminology/cache/tone-of-news-800x667.png" width="800" /></p><h3>Meeting strategic goals</h3><p>Interpreting an analysis is enriched when it can be viewed against an organization&rsquo;s communications strategy. The strategic goals of communications can be:</p><ul><li>Increased primary role in articles</li><li>Increased active role in articles</li><li>Decreased negative-toned publicity</li><li>Positive employee image</li><li>Increased visibility in the key publications of the industry</li><li>Increased visibility in the key publications of the region</li></ul><p>Meeting strategic goals can be examined on a timeline quarterly or annually, for instance.&nbsp;</p><p>The most important thing in monitoring visibility and public image is to work out the starting point for your organization and monitor what kind of effect your communication actions have on the results. The point of the analysis is to steer your communications and marketing &ndash; not just give empty numbers.</p><h2><a name="tavoittavuus"></a>2. Reach</h2><p>Reach means the potential amount of people that a certain publication reaches in a month. The word &ldquo;potential&rdquo; is a hint that it&rsquo;s not unique pairs of eyes that have actually seen the content on a certain site but more a suggestive crowd that a publication might reach in the ideal situation.</p><h3>Reach on a timeline</h3><p>Reach can also be monitored on a timeline. In this situation, the focus is on the changes that have occurred in how the reach has grown due to certain communication actions. When reach is measured on a timeline, the focus can also be reach in relation to competitors or comparative organizations.</p><h3>Reach index</h3><p>When reach index is taken as one of the factors under analysis, the most important media outlets for an organization should be known. In this case, the analysis can take into account that one mention about an organization in an important publication holds more relevance than 20 smaller mentions in publications that are not so relevant. Reach index can also be analyzed separately for online media and social media.</p><h2><a name="vertailu"></a>3. Comparison</h2><p>Comparison for different purposes and with different methods can be included in an analysis. Comparison can be done to other organizations in the industry or compare an organization&rsquo;s own visibility to an earlier analysis&rsquo; same timeframe.</p><h3>Competitor analysis</h3><p>Competitor analysis or comparative organization analysis (for example, when the analysis focuses on public sector organizations, competition is not really the term being used) analyzes the visibility of two or more organizations in online media. In this kind of analysis, a monitor is set to each organization and their public images are compared. One of the benefits of this type of analysis is that it can offer ideas on communication actions and provides a window to the operations of your dearest competitors in your particular industry.</p><h3>Share of voice</h3><p>Competitor comparison where the visibility of multiple organizations within an industry is depicted in the same pie chart. From the chart, it&rsquo;s easy to get an overview of how visibility is divided between different organizations.</p><p><img alt="" class="shadow-image" height="665" kv_aslink="0" src="https://www.lianatech.com/media/blog/media-analysis-terminology/cache/share-of-voice-en-800x665.png" width="800" />​​​​​​​</p><h3>Timeline comparison</h3><p>A big help to developing communications is timeline comparison, such as Q1/2020 vs. Q1/2021 or monitoring the development of visibility by quarter. In this type of analysis, the idea is to make observations during a certain timeline and then do communication efforts. The effects of these efforts are then examined in the next analysis that focuses on the next equivalent timeline.</p><div class="alert border border-200 bg-100"><strong>Also read:</strong>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.lianatech.com/resources/blog/why-you-should-utilize-media-analysis.html" target="_blank">Why You Should Utilize Media Analysis</a></div><h2><a name="arvo"></a>4. Value</h2><p>Calculations about the value of advertising are usually not included in a media analysis. However, those that work in communications, still have the need to understand the effectiveness and meaning of communications, and &ndash; to some extent &ndash; measure its value. Measuring visibility and reach and improving them when it comes to the publications that are the most important to your organization often bring more value than calculating advertising money. This is simply because it is difficult to determine a purely monetary value for the impact of communication and image building.&nbsp;</p><h3>AVE</h3><p>Advertising Value Equivalency aims to measure the value of communications in the same way as advertising value is calculated. Therefore, AVE compares communications content in a publication to what the same amount of space would cost as advertising space. This way of measuring is disapproved by The International Association for Measurement and Evaluation of Communication (AMEC) because very simply put: communications is not advertising.</p><h3>ROI</h3><p>ROI (Return on Investment) measures the amount of return on any investment.

		<title>How Can Media Monitoring Support Sales? – 6 Tips</title>
		<link>https://www.lianatech.com/resources/blog/how-can-media-monitoring-support-sales-6-tips.html</link>
		<description>Not everyone thinks of media monitoring when considering ways to improve an organization’s sales. Did you know that it can help you identify potential customers on various different steps on the buyer’s journey and find unique selling opportunities?</description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Media monitoring has various benefits for organizations, including controlling their reputation or responding to customers&rsquo; feedback or issues online. To maintain a reputable image, it&rsquo;s important to know the tone of voice people use when they talk about your business online, and to react to possible crises quickly.</p><p>However, not everyone thinks of media monitoring when considering ways to improve an organization&rsquo;s <strong>sales</strong>. Did you know that it can help you identify potential customers on various different steps on the buyer&rsquo;s journey and find unique selling opportunities?</p><p>Check out these 6 tips on how media monitoring can support sales, and add new keywords to your own monitor list:</p><ol><li><a href="#1">Changes in the industry</a></li><li><a href="#2">Word-of-mouth</a></li><li><a href="#3">Laws and regulations</a></li><li><a href="#4">Meeting agendas, RFPs, and new appointments</a></li><li><a href="#5">Industry trends and Key Opinion Leaders</a></li><li><a href="#6">Influential and local news</a></li></ol><h2><a name="1"></a>1. Changes in the industry</h2><p>It&rsquo;s important to keep up with the continuously evolving business environment you operate in. By following industry and competitor keywords, you&rsquo;re always in the loop of what&rsquo;s happening in the market. Industry-specific discussion on different forums and social media channels can guide you on where you should focus your marketing and sales efforts.</p><p>Your competitor&rsquo;s online visibility can also tell you a lot. If the attention they&rsquo;re getting is positive, it can give you hints on how you can improve your own marketing and sales. Negative comments, on the other hand, show you which mistakes to avoid &ndash; and if there are dissatisfied customers in need of a new product or service provider. Perhaps your company has a more suitable option to offer? 👀</p><p><img height="536" kv_aslink="0" src="https://www.lianatech.com/media/blog/how-can-media-monitoring-support-sales-6-tips/media-monitoring-report-may-12-copy.png" width="750" alt="" /></p><p class="small"><em>You can create automatic monitor reports about your brand based on different criteria, such as the channel in which your organization is mentioned. By creating similar reports about your competitors, you can compare your brand&rsquo;s visibility in journalistic and social media to theirs.&nbsp;</em></p><p>Changes in the industry don&rsquo;t only involve changes in individual businesses or fields &ndash; you should also consider keeping an eye on the constantly evolving <strong>sales</strong> and especially <strong>digital marketing methods</strong> used by businesses. It&rsquo;s crucial for sales specialists to be familiar with the latest changes in the fields of sales and marketing, such as the upcoming <a href="https://www.lianatech.com/resources/blog/the-end-of-third-party-cookies-how-to-prepare-with-digital-marketing-tools-infographic.html" target="_blank">end of third-party cookies</a>.</p><p>Make sure to follow various industry keywords to adapt to the changing environment quickly and effectively.&nbsp;</p><h2><a name="2"></a>2. Word-of-mouth</h2><p>Internet forums and social media are flooded with stories of both positive and negative customer experiences. People online tend to share information about products and reputable service providers, and also ask for recommendations of such. According to <a href="https://www.brightlocal.com/research/local-consumer-review-survey/" target="_blank">BrightLocal&rsquo;s 2020 study</a>, for instance, 79% of consumers trust online reviews as much as personal recommendations from friends and family.&nbsp;</p><p><img alt="" class="shadow-image" height="686" kv_aslink="0" src="https://www.lianatech.com/media/blog/how-can-media-monitoring-support-sales-6-tips/quora-example.png" width="700" /></p><p class="small"><em>Many people ask for recommendations on social media and websites such as <a href="https://www.quora.com/" target="_blank">Quora</a>.</em></p><p>Such online threads provide excellent opportunities for salespeople, as the users asking for recommendations or weighing different options are often very close to making purchase decisions on the buyer&rsquo;s journey.</p><p>However, these threads can be hard to find by simply browsing through different online platforms &ndash; especially since many online users don&rsquo;t tag the companies they&rsquo;re discussing in their posts. Media monitoring, on the other hand, automatically informs you of such opportunities with reports or notifications &ndash; all you need to do is follow the right keywords.</p><h3>Different keyword combinations</h3><p>In addition to monitoring your own brand and competitors, you might want to follow keywords related to the product or service categories your company offers. Pay attention to what kind of wording consumers in your industry use to find information about the different options available and adjust your monitored keywords accordingly.</p><p>In some cases, it might be useful to monitor both more general and detailed keyword combinations. They can include, for instance, your location or the most important competitive advantages of your organization, such as an affordable price-point, best quality, or free delivery. More detailed keyword combinations such as <em>affordable gym Helsinki</em> often provide you with the most relevant posts.</p><p>You can also adjust the monitor reports and notifications according to your needs based on the frequency and different channels, for example. You might want to set more frequent reports especially for the more detailed keyword combinations to be able to react to the best sales opportunities quickly.&nbsp;</p><h3>Join the conversation</h3><p>When you find threads where people are asking for recommendations, you can directly interact with them and tell them about your product or service. However, remember to be considerate and discreet &ndash; a subtle tip may be more efficient than spamming the potential customer with phone calls or private messages.&nbsp;</p><p>You can, for example:</p><ul><li>briefly describe the most important features and competitive advantages of your product or service</li><li>provide them with a link to help them find more information about you, or</li><li>tell them how they can contact you if they want to.</li></ul><p>You can also share or comment on the posts in which your company is mentioned. This works especially well for the companies that want to interact with their customers&nbsp;closely.</p><p><img alt="" height="1001" kv_aslink="0" src="https://www.lianatech.com/media/blog/how-can-media-monitoring-support-sales-6-tips/cache/social-media-copy-800x1024.png" width="800" /></p><p class="small"><em>Media monitoring allows you to find posts about your organization, even if you&rsquo;re not tagged in them. Interact with your customers by sharing and commenting to stay in touch with your existing customers and to attract new ones.</em></p><div class="alert border border-200 bg-100">Do you follow us on <a href="https://linkedin.com/company/liana-technologies" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/LianaTech" target="_blank">Twitter</a>?</div><h2><a name="3"></a>3. Laws and regulations</h2><p>Monitoring the laws and regulations related to your industry is always a good idea, as they can have a significant impact on people&rsquo;s purchasing behavior.&nbsp;</p><p>If new standards or requirements are set for specific equipment or devices, you can offer customers a new suitable model early on. New official recommendations related to exercise or nutrition, for example, can also create large changes in the markets, such as significant spikes in the demand for a certain product.</p><p>You can follow industry reports and related news to keep up with the upcoming changes. This allows you to prepare for them beforehand, consider them in your sales strategy, and to offer your customers new products according to the latest regulations.</p><p>Knowing the latest laws and regulations is also important in the actual sales operations themselves &ndash; complying with the latest GDPR regulations, for example, is crucial to companies in 2021.</p><h2><a name="4"></a>4. Meeting agendas, RFPs, and new appointments</h2><p>Cities&rsquo;, states&rsquo;, or other public organizations&rsquo; <strong>meeting agendas</strong> can provide you with important information. New projects and investments, for example, can be decided on well before their bidding process starts. Monitoring such agendas gives you a chance to contact the decision-makers early on.</p><p>You can also follow <strong>Requests for Proposals (RFPs)</strong> to hop onto the bidding later on &ndash; even if you missed the minutes of the meeting where the official decision took place. They can be found on various country or industry-specific websites, and media monitoring also helps you find the ones that are more hidden.</p><p>Following announcements of <strong>new appointments</strong> in companies provides you with great sales opportunities. Especially in the cases of changes in the board of an organization, changes are likely to occur &ndash; which often means new investments or business partners. By contacting the new decision-maker early on, you will surely be remembered when the changes start to take place.</p><h2><a name="5"></a>5. Industry trends and Key Opinion Leaders</h2><p>By following industry blogs, forums, and social media posts, you can get a good overall idea of the topics that spark the most conversation in your field. Media monitoring allows you to keep up with the latest trends in the industry.</p><p>When you monitor your own company and competitors, pay attention to the recurring themes and topics of the general discussion. Think about the following: in what context is your organization often mentioned? What does this tell about your target audience and what kind of sales opportunities arise from it?</p><p>On top of simply <em>recognizing</em> the latest trends, make sure to also pay attention to the people <em>setting</em> them: utilize <strong>Key Opinion Leaders (KOLs)</strong> in your sales and marketing. Media monitoring allows you to analyze the trendsetters in the industry &ndash; who are the individuals that are followed and trusted online?</p><p>According to <a href="https://influencermarketinghub.com/influencer-marketing-benchmark-report-2021/" target="_blank">Influencer Marketing Hub&rsquo;s 2021 study</a>, <strong>increasing sales is the main objective for influencer marketing campaigns</strong>. You can offer KOLs or social media influencers the opportunity for product reviews or invite them to your events.</p><p>By contacting Key Opinion Leaders and offering them products to try, you can reach completely new target groups that otherwise could have been completely out of reach for your marketing.</p><div class="alert border border-200 bg-100">Learn more about KOLs: <a href="https://www.lianatech.com/resources/blog/key-opinion-leaders-who-are-they-and-why-do-they-matter.html" target="_blank">Key Opinion Leaders: Who Are They and Why Do They Matter?</a></div><p><img alt="" class="shadow-image" height="657" kv_aslink="0" src="https://www.lianatech.com/media/blog/how-can-media-monitoring-support-sales-6-tips/cache/kol-example-1024x657.png" width="750" /></p><p class="small"><em>Many people look for healthy recipes online and tend to trust the KOLs in the industry, such as the registered dietitian <a href="https://www.abbeyskitchen.com/" target="_blank">Abbey Sharp</a>, who calls out false information about the food industry and shares knowledge with a scientific approach. Through sponsored posts and videos with such KOLs, companies are able to reach potential customers effectively.</em></p><h2><a name="6"></a>6. Influential and local news</h2><p>You should always stay in the loop of the latest news and current topics &ndash; not only because you&rsquo;re expected to, but also since they can create new market opportunities.</p><p>For example, significant changes in the political field or news about a company&rsquo;s unethical behavior can easily change consumers&rsquo; buying behavior and therefore create new sales opportunities.</p><p>By utilizing media monitoring, you can easily keep up with smaller local news as well, which allows you to target your marketing and sales locally. Is there a new residential area arising somewhere near you, or is some hobby perhaps focused on a particular area?</p><p>Many consumers and businesses prefer local product or service providers, which is why you might want to follow local news especially in your area.</p><h2>Are you new to media monitoring?</h2><p>An ambitious and hungry sales team is the best resource for successful sales operations. Selling requires creativity, and by offering your team a media monitoring tool to use, they will surely find new innovative ways to find leads.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.lianatech.com/solutions/pr-media/overview.html" target="_blank">LianaMonitor</a> is an effective and handy monitoring tool for both journalistic and social media.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Marketing automation is a great asset for marketing teams, as it is a versatile technology that enables marketers to implement targeted campaigns.&nbsp;</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.emailmonday.com/marketing-automation-statistics-overview/" target="_blank">Email Monday</a>, 51% of companies are currently using marketing automation, and <a href="https://www.lianatech.com/marketing-automation-survey-results-2.0.html" target="_blank">our latest survey</a> revealed that 30% of marketers who were not using it yet were planning to invest in the technology soon.</p><p>In a few words, marketing automation is a perfect tool for sending messages to the right person, at the right time; and it can be used for a lot of different campaigns, both in B2C or B2B.</p><p>B2C marketing automation is mostly used to send personalized messages and focus on improving customer experience, leading to a purchase. B2B marketing automation is, on the other hand, more &ldquo;mass-oriented&rdquo; and its goal is to maximize the conversion rate, to turn prospects into customers.</p><p>In this article, we will focus on marketing automation examples for B2C, and you will find at the end of your reading a <a href="#template">PDF file</a> with some more examples to keep close to hand.</p><p>&nbsp;Let&rsquo;s go 🏃&nbsp;</p><ul><li><a href="#one">Re-engage your customers</a></li><li><a href="#two">Collect more leads and nurture them</a></li><li><a href="#three">Generate upsells or cross-sells</a></li><li><a href="#four">Ask for a referral</a></li><li><a href="#five">Reach out after a recent purchase</a></li></ul><h1><a name="one"></a>Re-engage your customer</h1><p>One of every marketer&rsquo;s goals is to encourage their prospects and clients to engage with their brand. According to <a href="https://resources.industrydive.com/state-of-marketing-automation-2019-survey-report" target="_blank">Social Media Today</a>, 36% of marketers stated that marketing automation is a good way to improve customer engagement.&nbsp;</p><p>But what about re-engagement? Driving someone to interact with your brand is one thing, but pushing them to interact with you multiple times is another. Marketing automation enables you to create different scenarios to attract your audience once again.</p><p><strong>Scenario for a re-engagement automation chain:&nbsp;</strong></p><p>After the first contact with your brand, for example, logging in to your app or website, or after the user stops interacting with your newsletter, you can wait a few days and send them a reminder to take a course or check your latest content.</p><p>It can be an email or a push notification on their phone. You can decide to set another reminder a few days after your first if they still don&rsquo;t come back to you.</p><p><img alt="" height="689" kv_aslink="0" src="https://www.lianatech.com/media/blog/b2c-marketing-automation-examples-pdf/re-engagement-.png" width="680" /></p><p><a href="https://www.duolingo.com/" target="_blank">Duolingo</a> always reminds you about a pending lesson if you haven&rsquo;t practiced in a few days. Their automation chain is designed so that even if you re-engage regularly, you will receive a notification if you don&rsquo;t open the app after a certain number of days.</p><h1><a name="two"></a>Collect more leads and nurture them</h1><p>When it comes to leads, you can create simple automation for lead generation, and decide to complexify it a little bit to nurture your lead afterward.</p><p><strong>Scenarios for a lead generation and lead nurturing automation chain:&nbsp;</strong></p><p><u>Scenario 1:</u></p><p>One of the ways to create a marketing automation chain for lead generation is through a form on your website. This can be a guide download or some instructions regarding your product or service.&nbsp;</p><p>The chain will then only consist of a trigger (filling the form) and an email with the content that the user has downloaded. Easy, right?</p><p><u>Scenario 2:</u></p><p>If you want to nurture this lead, you can add some more elements to your existing automation chain. After the download, wait 2 or 3 days and then send another email with some more information regarding the content that has been downloaded.&nbsp;</p><p>It can be a testimonial or related content that can interest your reader, for example.&nbsp;</p><p><img alt="" height="1200" kv_aslink="0" src="https://www.lianatech.com/media/blog/b2c-marketing-automation-examples-pdf/lead-generation-automation-image.png" width="1200" /></p><p class="small">Marketing automation chain for lead generation: you can find more illustrated examples in our PDF, that you can download at the end of this article.</p><div class="alert border border-200 bg-100">💡 In our latest email marketing survey (<a href="https://www.lianatech.com/the-state-of-email-marketing.html" target="_blank">The State of Email Marketing 2021</a>), we found out that <strong>51%</strong> of the respondents use marketing automation for lead generation.</div><h1><a name="three"></a>Generate upsells and cross-sells</h1><p>With the help of marketing automation, you can also create some up- and cross-selling campaigns.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Scenario for an upselling or cross-selling automation chain: &nbsp;</strong></p><p>After a first purchase, you can send a first follow-up email to your first customer or returning client.&nbsp;</p><p>Sometime later (it can be a week), send them another email to promote the premium version of your service or another product that they could make good use of after their initial purchase, for example.</p><p>But you can also make this automation chain shorter by sending the up- or cross-selling proposition email a week after the first purchase, without the follow-up email.</p><p><img alt="" height="1210" kv_aslink="0" src="https://www.lianatech.com/media/blog/b2c-marketing-automation-examples-pdf/upsell-email.png" width="680" /></p><p><a href="https://quizlet.com/en-gb" target="_blank">Quizlet</a> offers their customer a free trial of their Plus version after the use of their service.&nbsp;</p><h1><a name="four"></a>Ask for a referral</h1><p>Asking for a referral is a way to reach out to your customers and potentially perform more sales. By offering something in exchange for a referral (it can be a promotional code, or winning a gift voucher), you have the opportunity to stay in the customer&rsquo;s mind, and to get more leads afterward.</p><p><strong>Scenario for a referral automation chain:&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The basic automation chain for a referral is to thank the user for their purchase or their sign-up and to include in the email a personal code, for example. This personal code will be used to track which customers referred the brand to their friends.&nbsp;</p><p>The use of that personal code can then be set as a trigger to send an automated email to the customer, thanking them for the referral, and reminding them about the benefit they received.</p><p><img alt="" height="1604" kv_aslink="0" src="https://www.lianatech.com/media/blog/b2c-marketing-automation-examples-pdf/referral-email.png" width="680" /></p><p>After referring <a href="https://allsetnow.com/" target="_blank">Allset</a> to a friend, the customer gets as an incentive $10, but it&rsquo;s not all, since the customer will receive this amount of money each time they refer the brand to someone, using their referral code.&nbsp;</p><h1><a name="five"></a>Reach out after a recent purchase</h1><p>Reaching out after a purchase is a great way to keep your customers&rsquo; attention, which can lead to another purchase later in the future. This type of email doesn&rsquo;t need to be an offer for another product, like the up-selling or cross-selling automation chain.&nbsp;</p><p>If you have a blog, you can send them blog articles concerning your products, or it can be tips on how to use your product or service. This way, you&rsquo;ll stay in the back of their head, and if the opportunity comes, they might purchase from you again.</p><p><strong>Scenario for a recent purchase automation chain:&nbsp;</strong></p><p>If you are, for example, selling beauty products, you can send an email a few days after the purchase and give some tips on how to apply the lipstick that they just bought, and what colors they can wear it with.&nbsp;</p><p><img alt="" height="1338" kv_aslink="0" src="https://www.lianatech.com/media/blog/b2c-marketing-automation-examples-pdf/recent-purchase-email.png" width="680" /></p><p>In their follow-up email, the beauty brand <a href="https://iliabeauty.com/" target="_blank">Ilia</a> reminds their customers of their values and the CTA enables the reader to go again on the website.&nbsp;</p><h1>Wrapping up</h1><p>Setting up an automation chain doesn&rsquo;t need to be a complicated process. You can start with short and easy chains, and then complexify them once you master the process a little bit more.&nbsp;</p><p>Marketing automation makes marketers&rsquo; lives easier, as they enable us to save a lot of manual time and to send the right messages at the right time. There are plenty of ways to use this technology, so if you are not familiar with it yet, now is the time to get started.&nbsp;</p><p>Oh, and don&rsquo;t forget to download our <a name="template"></a>PDF template, with practical workflow examples in both beginner and advanced level ️⬇️</p><p><a href="https://www.lianatech.com/media/downloadable-guides/liana-automation-workflows-eng.pdf" target="_blank"><span class="btn btn-outline-primary">Download my PDF</span></a></p><p>Looking for a marketing automation tool? <a href="https://www.lianatech.com/contact-us/contact.html" target="_blank">Contact us</a> to know more about LianaAutomation and get a personalized demo for your needs.</p>]]></content:encoded>

One of the biggest advantages of the study is the focus on the design part of newsletter creation, which has been neglected by previous studies of the same kind.&nbsp;</p><p>We got answers from 240 email marketers from Finland, Sweden, France, Germany, the United Arab Emirates, and Hong Kong.</p><p>In this blog article, we highlight some of the survey results.

		<description>Marketing automation helps to target and schedule more efficient event communications. Automations make it possible to schedule messages beforehand and target them to certain audiences based on their participation, behavior, or other data.  This allows the organizer to create automation workflows that make the arrangements easier and more efficient.</description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Arranging an event takes a lot of work and includes a list of things to remember&nbsp;&ndash; whether the occasion is live, online, or as a hybrid, combining both. Especially the needs for communications vary between different event genres. Invitations, tickets, confirmation messages, reminders, and other informative messages &ndash; not to even mention marketing &ndash; there&rsquo;s a lot to remember.</p><p>That&rsquo;s why every event organizer&rsquo;s toolkit should include marketing automation.</p><p>Marketing automation helps to <strong>target</strong> and <strong>schedule</strong> more efficient event communications. Automations make it possible to schedule messages beforehand and target them to certain audiences based on their participation, behavior, or other data.</p><p>This allows the organizer to create automation workflows that make the arrangements easier and more efficient. By using marketing automation, the organizer makes sure that all event data is utilized and visible for the whole organization.</p><p><strong>Let&rsquo;s begin to explore the marketing automation possibilities within event communications.

At its best, a hybrid event can combine the best of both worlds within online and live events, bringing together a broader and maybe even more international audience.</p><p>But how to get there and make sure everything goes smoothly? This is where good event communication steps in. Make sure to communicate in such a way that makes your audience understand the new hybrid event concept and get realistic expectations from it. With hybrid events, it&rsquo;s especially important to target the messaging based on participation type: the online participants don&rsquo;t need to hear from live location arrival instructions and the live participants on the other hand don&rsquo;t get extra value from webinar software advice.</p><p><a href="https://www.eventilla.com/en/arranging-a-webinar-webinar-faq/?utm_source=lianablogEN&amp;utm_medium=lianablogEN&amp;utm_campaign=efficient-event-communications-with-automations" target="_blank">Online events and webinars</a> have entered our lives by the latest during last year. The communications for online events should also be informative. Participants want to know at least the technical requirements of how to follow the event and how to join the fun. Good communications bring added value to the event experience. For example, try handing out some additional materials to support the program.</p><p><img alt="" class="shadow-image" height="1220" kv_aslink="0" src="https://www.lianatech.com/media/blog/efficient-event-communications-with-marketing-automation/marketing-automation-in-hybrid-and-online-events-automation-workflow-eng.png" width="1320" /></p><h2><a name="numbertwo"></a>Planning the marketing automation</h2><p>You&rsquo;re probably already familiar with one of the most important principles of marketing: knowing your customer personas. This works as a good starting point for planning the event communications and automation too.</p><p>Who are the ideal participants of your event? What media do they use and read? What are their motivations for participating in the event and what use will they get out of it? These are some of the important questions that should stand at the base of your event communications. <a href="https://www.eventilla.com/en/event-communications-and-marketing/?utm_source=lianablogEN&amp;utm_medium=lianablogEN&amp;utm_campaign=efficient-event-communications-with-automations" target="_blank">Here you&rsquo;ll find more tips for event communications</a>.</p><p>After you&rsquo;ve defined the ideal participant type, you can start to focus on how those persons will end up participating in your event. Have they shown their interest by subscribing to your newsletter or clicking a CTA button? Or have they already taken the beginners&rsquo; version of the same course? These are some questions that guide you in finding the base for the audience you&rsquo;ll want to invite.</p><p>And just like that, you&rsquo;ve now created segments to target the marketing automation messages to.</p><h2><a name="numberthree"></a>How to utilize marketing automation in hybrid and online events</h2><p>Next, we&rsquo;ll walk you through the six steps of how to utilize marketing automation in hybrid and online event communications:</p><ol><li><a href="#1">Event visibility online</a></li><li><a href="#2">Invitations and marketing</a></li><li><a href="#3">Confirmation messages</a></li><li><a href="#4">Reminders and informative messages</a></li><li><a href="#5">Communications during the event</a></li><li><a href="#6">Communications after the event</a></li></ol><p><img alt="" class="shadow-image" height="2352" kv_aslink="0" src="https://www.lianatech.com/media/blog/efficient-event-communications-with-marketing-automation/marketing-automation-in-hybrid-and-online-events-infographic-eng-.png" width="1200" /></p><h3><a name="1"></a>1. Event visibility online</h3><p>Digital marketing needs a home base &ndash; a landing page that provides more information for the person browsing online. Create your event a landing page with a registration form. The registration form fields should then collect all the needed participant data safely into one place. Instead of collecting many Excel files or trying to keep up with the registrant count in your head, we recommend using event management software. This will also make sure that all the needed data from special diets to preference questions is collected and possible to anonymize when needed.</p><p><em>Tip! When the registration process is integrated with marketing automation, you can utilize the form field answers and choices when targeting automated messages.</em></p><p>This way the participant data collection is automated and you&rsquo;ll be able to focus on other tasks.</p><h3><a name="2"></a>2.&nbsp;Invitations and marketing</h3><p>As the webinar or hybrid event is held at least partially online, it&rsquo;s only natural to send the invitations digitally. Sending digital invitations is the easiest with email marketing, newsletter, or marketing automation software. This also allows message automation and targeting.</p><p>How to utilize marketing automation when sending out invitations:</p><ul><li><strong>Schedule</strong> the invitations beforehand, to be sent a certain time before the event. Depending on the event&rsquo;s nature, we recommend sending them at least a couple of weeks before. However, sometimes even a save-the-date message that is sent months prior to the event might be needed.</li><li><strong>Target</strong> the invitations to the audience of your choice. With the help of data that is fetched to marketing automation, you can target to&hellip;<ul><li>Participants of all or some of your events</li><li>Earlier participants who have shown interest in the upcoming events by filling out some specific form field when registering</li><li>Those who chose to answer a certain question on your feedback form (try for example: &ldquo;Are you interested in participating in our events in the future?&rdquo;)</li><li>Newsletter subscribers</li><li>List of people who downloaded your website materials</li></ul></li><li>Schedule and target another <strong>reminder</strong> invite for those who haven&rsquo;t yet registered by a certain date and time.</li></ul><h3><a name="3"></a>3.&nbsp;Confirmation message</h3><p>When the participants have registered for an event or bought a ticket, they often expect to receive a confirmation message, stating that the registration has been completed successfully.</p><p>An event management software like <a href="https://www.eventilla.com/en/introduction/features/" target="_blank">Eventilla</a> usually sends out the confirmation messages automatically via email, right after the registration has been made. You can also allow the participant to edit their own participation information with just one click in the confirmation message.</p><p>When it comes to hybrid events, you should always remember to state the participation type in the confirmation message, so that the participant can check whether the ticket is for the online or live event.</p><h3><a name="4"></a>4. Reminders and informative messages</h3><p>Events tend to have many different communication needs, like reminders, informative messages, instructions, or maybe even some inspirational letters. What they all have in common is that it takes time to plan and write the texts and content. Especially in a hurry, it&rsquo;s easy to make mistakes <em>(we all know the frustration caused by even the smallest typo)</em>.</p><p>That&rsquo;s why all event communications should be automated way before prime time. We always recommend planning the event communications cycle as a whole, and well ahead. Consider at least these: What should the participants know before the event? Do they need additional information about the arrangements or should they prepare in some way?</p><p><strong>Other useful ideas:</strong></p><ul><li>Especially online events and webinars are easy to forget. Haven&rsquo;t we all at least once registered for a webinar, only to notice to have forgotten it the next day&hellip; That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s good to offer a calendar link, so the participants can add the event and reminders to their own calendars. We also recommend sending a reminder message at least 15 minutes before the event. This reminder should include the webinar link and instructions on how to join.</li><li>Hybrid event communications should always be targeted based on the participation type. Live event participants will most likely want to know the arrival instructions at least one day before, online participants on the other hand are usually happy with receiving the webinar stream links on the event day. Here you&rsquo;ll find more tips for hybrid event communications.&nbsp;</li><li>You can also target automated reminder and information messaging based on the registration form field choices. For example, try sending out recommendations about accommodation options nearby to those who chose &ldquo;I need accommodation at the venue&rdquo; when registering.</li></ul><h3><a name="5"></a>5.&nbsp;Communications during the event</h3><p>Sometimes it&rsquo;s necessary to communicate to the audience also during the event. If the messaging need is urgent, we recommend choosing SMS, because it usually reaches the receiver a bit faster than email.</p><p>You can also schedule marketing automation messages during the event, for both email and SMS. Try for example sending the participants additional materials about the event program in PDF form or reminding them about the upcoming speakers. When you&rsquo;ve scheduled the messages to be sent at the right time, you&rsquo;ll be able to focus on other arrangements yourself.</p><h3><a name="6"></a>6.&nbsp;Communications after the event</h3><p>You shouldn&rsquo;t forget the participants even after the event. After all, they gave you some of their valuable time by choosing to attend your event.</p><p>Communications after the event is usually wise to target based on the participation data&nbsp;&ndash; meaning if the participant actually joined the webinar or came to the venue, or if they missed it entirely.</p><p>Those who were present should receive a thank you note, and most importantly a feedback survey. When planning the survey, it&rsquo;s good to remember that even those feedback survey form fields can be used with targeting marketing automation in the future. Would you like to ask the ones who gave poor feedback about their reasonings or development suggestions later on? Or target your next event&rsquo;s marketing for those who said they were interested to participate in the future too? You can also set up an alert from very poor feedback, giving you a chance to notice it and react in time.</p><p>However, you shouldn&rsquo;t forget those who registered but never showed up at the event. Especially online events and webinars are often followed up with an event recording, and that&rsquo;s why many also expect to get the recording afterwards by only registering. And when it comes to future events, this audience is also a delicious one to target to.&nbsp;</p><p><img alt="" height="632" kv_aslink="0" src="https://www.lianatech.com/media/blog/efficient-event-communications-with-marketing-automation/cache/marketing-automation-in-hybrid-and-online-events-automation-reminder-message-eng-579x632.png" width="579" /></p><p>But how to get the participation data to a marketing automation software? Webinar integration with an event management software makes it possible to follow participation data and this way also target the messages based on the participant&rsquo;s presence. Hybrid event live participation on the other hand can be tracked for example by scanning QR-coded tickets.</p><h2>Efficient event management with Eventilla</h2><p>Eventilla is an event management tool that makes it possible to create brand-like landing pages, registration processes, reports, communications, and surveys.
